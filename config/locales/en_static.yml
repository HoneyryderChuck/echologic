        why:
          title: Why do we need echo?

          text: |
            <p>
            The world is changing. Today humanity is facing some serious environmental, economic and humanitarian
            challenges never seen before. However, satisfactory solutions are not in sight. The lack of transparency
            in political decision making provokes a growing sense of <strong>powerlessness</strong> and
            <strong>political resignation</strong> among the population and weakens people's faith in democracy.
            Calls for <strong>transparency</strong> and more <strong>participation</strong> are growing louder.
            </p><p>
            The current crises can thus be understood as a general <strong>crisis of democracy</strong>.<br/>
            New ways have to be found, empowering people to develop <strong>constructive solutions</strong> to effectively tackle
            our <span title="{{tooltip}}" class="ttLink">“glocal” challenges</span>.
            </p>

          tooltip: |
            Our ecological, economical and humanitarian challenges at local and global level are tightly
            related to each other. These problems cannot be tackled independently, but must be understood and
            solved as a whole with regard to their complex interrelations.

        what:
          title: What is echo?

          text: |
            <p>
            echo is the instrument for a <strong>new kind of participatory democracy</strong> facing these challenges.
            Unlike <span title="{{tooltip1}}" class="ttLink">usual Web 2.0 applications</span>, echo provides
            a <strong>clearly structured <span title="{{tooltip2}}" class="ttLink">opinion base</span></strong> and allows
            for a <strong>solution-oriented</strong> social collaboration. It unites technical innovation and human scientific knowledge
            into a unique concept. This helps people to better understand backgrounds and interrelations of topics,
            jointly make sound decisions and turn them into reality. Accordingly, echo comes with three main functional
            areas: <strong>Discuss – Connect – Act</strong>!
            </p><p>
            Through the combination of these three functional areas, echo establishes a unique virtual space for a
            fully democratic collaboration, which is able to lead to <strong>visible results in everyday life</strong>
            of the people with minimal effort.<br/>
            Additionally, by spreading its functionality <strong>beyond the limits of individual websites</strong>,
            echo lets all forces be bundled for a <strong>sustainable change</strong> throughout the whole internet.
            </p>

          tooltip1: |
            Forums allow for an open discussion but do not provide any structured, measurable results.
            Group blogs cannot be written by hundreds and thousands of participants. Wikipedia can only
            maintain its quality by putting the control over the content into the hands of a few
            administrators – which is fairly undemocratic.

          tooltip2: |
            In analogy to Wikipedia, providing the biggest open accessible knowledge base with a focus
            on objective facts, echo aims to provide the world's most comprehensive opinion base focusing
            on subjective opinions and also to facilitate constructive discussions on them.

      discuss:
        title: Discuss

        text: |
          <p>
          Get a detailed overview of the current public opinion! Engage in discussions! Convince others of your position!
          </p><p>
          The discussion area of echo lets for the first time <strong>collective intelligence</strong> emerge in a
          democratic public discourse even with a nearly unlimited number of participants.<br/>
          In order to achieve this, the <strong>novel discussion method</strong> of echo unites some essential features:
          </p>

        clarity: Clarity
        clarity_more: |
          Through only one search entry and a few clicks, echo´s multilingual search mechanism provides you with a
          clear overview of the most supported positions concerning a specific topic of interest.

        transparency: Transparency
        transparency_more: |
          On echo, all positions as well as their supporting arguments are permanently presented in
          contrast to the most relevant alternative ones. This helps people to easily develop a
          differentiated view and thus to prevent polemic and populism.

        detailed: Detailed opinion base
        detailed_more: |
          On echo, all positions as well as their arguments can be supported by the users.
          This allows you to easily comprehend the exact support of such alternative positions by
          different groups of the society at any time.
          <br/><br/>
          <u>For example:</u> How many people in the world are for and against nuclear power? What do the Europeans think?
          What do physicists say and what about affected people living near Chernobyl or a nuclear waste repository?
          And finally, what is the position of a certain organisation?

        democratic: Democratic opinion formation
        democratic_more: |
          On echo, all positions represent sound statements elaborated by the users in a
          <span title="{{tooltip}}" class="ttLink">fully democractic process</span>.
          Thus, all people can contribute to the dynamic evolution of such statements with equal chance and a minimal effort.

        democratic_tooltip: |
          The collective development of such statements on echo does (in the normal case) not depend on
          moderators or any users with privileged roles. This ensures that all participants have an equal
          voice in the whole discussion process of echo.

        glocal: Glocal overview
        glocal_more: |
          echo helps people to easily comprehend thematic interrelations between local, regional and global topics.
          <br/><br/>
          <u>For example:</u> Prices at the supermarket in the neighbourhood => factory farming in the EU => deforestation for soy-plantation => world climate change.
          <br/><br/>
          This “glocal” overview enables users to see local issues in their global context and to understand global
          problems as a result of <strong>local circumstances</strong>. People, who visit echo because of a very local topic of
          personal interest (prices in the supermarket), are quickly confronted with its <strong>global implications</strong> (climate change).

      connect:
        title: Connect

        text_top: |
          <p>
          Find the right allies to achive your goals!
          </p><p>
          In contrast to current social networks, echo offers a highly specific search mechanism to easily
          <strong>find allies with different forms of competence</strong> with respect to a certain topic.
          Accordingly, echo divides all found users into different groups reflecting the most
          important segments of society. These are:
          </p>

        list: &competences |
          <li>Citizens and affected people (with competence with regard to needs)</li>
          <li>Experts and scientists (with professional competence)</li>
          <li>Politicians and other representatives (with decision making competence)</li>
          <li>Non-governmental and governmental organizations (with action competence & mobilization potential)</li>

        text_bottom: |
          <p>
          echo actively motivates dialogue and collaboration between these groups. By incorporating the needs und
          competences of these segments of society, echo enables people to jointly identify issues of common
          interest and <strong>develop the best possible solutions</strong> to these issues.
          </p>

      act:
        title: Act

        text_top: |
          <p>
          Become active! Reach your goals successfully!
          </p><p>
          To <strong>achieve noticeable results in everyday life</strong>, echo motivates
          all participants of a discussion to create appropriate actions to turn their proposals into reality.
          By bundling all local, regional and global actions supporting a common goal, echo creates
          new synergies and boosts the <strong>influence potential</strong> of civil engagment.
          The range of supported actions on echo covers:

          echo's  action area bridges the gap between virtual discussions and real-world actions.
          By linking these actions to existing <strong>legislative instruments</strong>,
          echo turns, for the first time, civil engagement into true <strong>political participation</strong>.

          <u>For example:</u> 20 000 Bavarian citizens voted against nuclear power – a number large enough to initiate a
          referendum. In a moment, all voters receive a message encouraging them to organize the referendum.
          Following the link included in the message, the users find themselves in a <strong>fully equipped
          virtual action space</strong>, providing all tools and information to collectively plan and organize the action.
          </p><p>
          In order to facilitate an effective collaboration, echo provides participants of an action with all
          <strong>necessary information</strong> and an <strong>appropriate toolset</strong>. Besides the
          innovative decision making function, this toolset contains by default several communication and
          process tools, calendar, event- and task management, file sharing and a fundraising function.
          Thanks to its <strong>modular design</strong>, the offered set of tools can be extended to
          faciliate different sorts of collaboration with specific needs.

          In order to overcome the limitations of individual platforms, echo employs a
          <strong>distributed approach</strong> and makes its functionality available
          throughout the whole Internet. Accordingly, relevant discussions and actions
          from echo can be displayed and edited on any web page and blog.
          In this way, echo complements the functionality of other platforms and creates
          <strong>true synergies</strong>, instead of hamstringing competition.
          <br/>
          As a result, echo bundles the forces of all existing civil engagement on the Internet and
          enables, for the first time ever, a <strong>broad wave of change</strong> to emerge in society.
          </p><p>
          For the realization of this goal, Google and its brand new <strong>Wave Federation Protocol</strong>
          comes just at the right time.  This open source technology not only allows real time social
          collaboration, but also provides the basis for a secure exchange of decentrally stored data on
          profiles, discussions and actions between public and your own organizational or private echo servers.
          </p><p>
          On the basis of the innovative concept of echo and the groundbreaking technology of
          Google Wave, <strong>echo on waves</strong> lays out the ground for the joint
          development of one of the most ambitious <strong>open source</strong> projects ever:

          Through their research work and new findings, experts and scientists provide socio-political decisions
          with a solid fundament. With their professional know-how, they can make significant contributions to the
          quality of discussions and to the development of adequate solution proposals.
          For this reason, they are <strong>vitally important actors</strong> on echo and can benefit

          <strong>Political and economic decision makers</strong> carry the largest social responsibility.
          They must decide what best serves the common good and negotiate feasible solutions
          with all stakeholders. Therefore, their participation in discussions on echo is of
          essential importance. If their efforts are to result in sustainable improvements,
          they need to <strong>win broad support from civil society</strong> for their proposals.
          Thus, a comprehensible presentation of their goals and a deep understanding of
          the citizen´s needs are basic prerequisits for their success.
          echo offers <strong>unique opportunities</strong> to politicians and other representatives
          to significantly increase the effectivity of their work:

          working cost-neutral.
          It also means helping people and organizations to provide their actions with the necessary funds.
          For this puropse, echo offers you various <span title="{{tooltip_costneutral}}" class="ttLink">cost-neutral</span>
          ways to collect money on your personal virtual account.
          All funds collected in these ways can then be donated to actions and projects of organisations, interest

          In this way, your virtual engagement can influence our real world in a positive way.

          echo reserves the right to initially cover its expenses from a part of its revenues.
          However, it is important to note, that all fundraising provisions will be reduced to zero,
          as soon as other business models targeted at commercial users of echo have been
          launched and can fully cover its operating costs. Thereby, echo’s entire finances will, of course,
          remain completely transparent.

        tooltip_costneutral: |
          Donation costs money? Not necessarily! Through echo, you can e.g. go to several online shops and
          have up to 20% of the price you paid for your favourite product transferred onto your virtual
          echo account. In addition, discreet notifications of thematically relevant products and services

          echo is designed to be a <strong>self-organizing system</strong>. Its innovative decision making
          method is perfectly apt for decisions concerning its own rules and functions.  In this way all
          users can participate increasingly in the evolution of echo, resulting in a <strong>stable
          self-administration</strong> at the end of this process.
          </p><p>
          As echo is an instrument of democratic decision making, maintaining
          <strong>political and financial independence</strong> is of vital importance.
          In order to ensure such independence in the long term, echo will gradually be
          <span title="{{tooltip}}" class="ttLink">passed into the hands</span> of all its users
          at any given time.
          </p><p>
          In this way, echo becomes the quasi <strong>property of humanity</strong>:
          They decide what on echo happens. They define how echo works. They are echo!

          open and transparent process.

          <p>
          echo social is a <strong>joint venture between echo source e.V. and the brueckenschlager network</strong>.
          It is supported by a growing number of partner organizations and projects.
          </p><p>
          An <strong>interdisciplinary team</strong> of young and experienced humanists and developers is working determined to
          achieve our common goals. This intensive engagement has been made possible by the financial support of the
          European Union, European Social Fund for Germany, the German Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology
          and private donors.
          </p><p>
          As a project for creating synergies, echo social itself arises out of a <strong>community project with
          joint efforts</strong>! If your organization would also like to engage into in the evolution of echo social,
