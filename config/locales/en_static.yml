          The agora was the central place in ancient Athens – the cradle of democracy.
          It was the hub of the social and political life of the polis: a society self-governed by its free citizens.
          echo, as the global agora, overcomes the communicative and spatial limits of the ancient agora and
          makes it accessible for all people on the planet.

          <strong>echo</strong> is an internet project for citizen empowerment. Our goal is to establish a
          <strong>new form of participatory democracy</strong> on the very local, as well as on the regional and global level.
          </p>

          echo heralds a <strong>new era of politics</strong> and democratic collaboration.
          It enables engaged citizens, experts, representatives and their organizations to take part in
          solution-oriented discussions and mobilize supporters to jointly turn their decisions into reality.
          echo's novel discussion method thereby lets, for the first time, <strong>collective intelligence</strong>
          emerge in a democratic public discourse even with a nearly unlimited number of participants.
          In this way, echo empowers people all over the world to collaborate in a constructive manner and
          jointly determine their very local living space, as well as the future of our common world.
          Additionally, echo's <strong>Your-Profit</strong> business philosophy effectively supports people
          to successfully achieve their goals.
          </p><p>
          By facilitating new means of transnational and intercultural collaboration, echo aims to foster a
          global consciousness and smoothen the path towards a peaceful, equitable and
          <strong>sustainable future</strong>.

        why:
          title: Why do we need echo?

          text: |
            <p>
            The world is changing. Today humanity is facing some serious environmental, economic and humanitarian
            challenges never seen before. However, satisfactory solutions are not in sight. The lack of transparency
            in political decision making provokes a growing sense of <strong>powerlessness</strong> and
            <strong>political resignation</strong> among the population and weakens people's faith in democracy.
            Calls for <strong>transparency</strong> and more <strong>participation</strong> are growing louder.
            </p><p>
            The current crises can thus be understood as a general <strong>crisis of democracy</strong>.<br/>
            New ways have to be found, empowering people to develop <strong>constructive solutions</strong> to effectively tackle
            our <span title="{{tooltip}}" class="ttLink">“glocal” challenges</span>.
            </p>

          tooltip: |
            Our ecological, economical and humanitarian challenges at local and global level are tightly
            related to each other. These problems cannot be tackled independently, but must be analyzed and
            solved as a whole with regard to their complex interrelations.

        what:
          title: What is echo?

          text: |
            <p>
            echo is the instrument for a <strong>new kind of participatory democracy</strong> facing these challenges.
            Unlike <span title="{{tooltip1}}" class="ttLink">usual Web 2.0 applications</span>, echo provides
            a <strong>clearly structured <span title="{{tooltip2}}" class="ttLink">opinion base</span></strong> and allows
            for a <strong>solution-oriented</strong> social collaboration. It unites technical innovation and human scientific knowledge
            into a unique concept. This helps people to better understand backgrounds and interrelations of topics,
            jointly make sound decisions and turn them into reality. Accordingly, echo comes with three main functional
            areas: <strong>Discuss – Connect – Act</strong>!
            </p><p>
            Through the combination of these three functional areas, echo establishes a unique virtual space for a
            fully democratic collaboration, which is able to lead to <strong>visible results in everyday life</strong>
            of the people with minimal effort.<br/>
            Additionally, by spreading its functionality <strong>beyond the limits of individual websites</strong>,
            echo lets all forces be bundled for a <strong>sustainable change</strong> throughout the whole internet.
            </p>

          tooltip1: |
            Forums allow for an open discussion but do not provide any structured, measurable results.
            Group blogs cannot be written by hundreds and thousands of participants. Wikipedia can only
            maintain its quality by putting the control over the content into the hands of a few
            administrators – which is fairly undemocratic.

          tooltip2: |
            In analogy to Wikipedia, providing the biggest open accessible knowledge base with a focus
            on objective facts, echo aims to provide the world's most comprehensive opinion base focusing
            on subjective opinions and also to facilitate constructive discussions on them.

      discuss:
        title: Discuss

        text: |
          <p>
          Get a detailed overview of the current public opinion! Engage in discussions! Convince others of your position!
          </p><p>
          The discussion area of echo lets for the first time <strong>collective intelligence</strong> emerge in a
          democratic public discourse even with a nearly unlimited number of participants.<br/>
          In order to achieve this, the <strong>novel discussion method</strong> of echo unites some essential innovations:
          </p>

        clarity: Clarity
        clarity_more: |
          Through only one search entry and a few clicks, echo´s multilingual search mechanism provides you with a
          clear overview of the most supported positions concerning a specific topic of interest.

        transparency: Transparency
        transparency_more: |
          On echo, all positions as well as their supporting arguments are permanently presented in
          contrast to the most relevant alternative ones. This helps people to easily develop a
          differentiated view and thus to prevent polemic and populism.

        detailed: Detailed opinion base
        detailed_more: |
          On echo, all positions as well as their arguments can be supported by the users.
          This allows you to easily comprehend the exact support of such alternative positions by
          different groups of the society at any time.
          <br/><br/>
          <u>For example:</u> How many people in the world are for and against nuclear power? What do the Europeans think?
          What do physicists say and what about affected people living near Chernobyl or a nuclear waste repository?
          And finally, what is the position of a certain organisation?

        democratic: Democratic opinion formation
        democratic_more: |
          On echo, all positions represent sound statements elaborated by the users in a
          <span title="{{tooltip}}" class="ttLink">fully democractic process</span>.
          Thus, all people can contribute to the dynamic evolution of such statements with equal chance and a minimal effort.

        democratic_tooltip: |
          The collective development of such statements on echo does (in the normal case) not depend on
          moderators or any users with privileged roles. This ensures that all participants have an equal
          voice in the whole discussion process of echo.

        glocal: Glocal overview
        glocal_more: |
          echo helps people to easily comprehend thematic interrelations between local, regional and global topics.
          <br/><br/>
          <u>For example:</u> Prices at the supermarket in the neighbourhood => factory farming in the EU => deforestation for soy-plantation => world climate change.
          <br/><br/>
          This “glocal” overview enables users to see local issues in their global context and to understand global
          problems as a result of <strong>local circumstances</strong>. People, who visit echo because of a very local topic of
          personal interest (prices in the supermarket), are quickly confronted with its <strong>global implications</strong> (climate change).

      connect:
        title: Connect

        text_top: |
          <p>
          Find the right allies to achive your goals!
          </p><p>
          In contrast to current social networks, echo offers a highly specific search mechanism to easily
          <strong>find allies with different forms of competence</strong> with respect to a certain topic.
          Accordingly, echo divides all found users into different groups reflecting the most
          important segments of society. These are:
          </p>

        list: &competences |
          <li>Citizens and affected people (with competence with regard to needs)</li>
          <li>Experts and scientists (with professional competence)</li>
          <li>Politicians and other representatives (with decision making competence)</li>
          <li>Non-governmental and governmental organizations (with mobilization potential)</li>

        text_bottom: |
          <p>
          echo actively motivates dialogue and collaboration between these groups. By incorporating the needs und
          competences of these segments of society, echo enables people to jointly identify issues of common
          interest and <strong>develop the best possible solutions</strong> to these issues.
          </p>

      act:
        title: Act

        text_top: |
          <p>
          Become active! Reach your goals successfully!
          </p><p>
          To <strong>achieve noticeable results in everyday life</strong> of the people, echo motivates
          all participants of a discussion to create appropriate actions to turn their proposals into reality.
          By bundling all local, regional and global actions supporting a common goal, echo creates
          new synergies and boosts the <strong>influence potential</strong> of civil engagment.
          The range of supported actions on echo covers:
          </p>

        possible_actions: |
          <li>digitally signed e-petitions,</li>
          <li>organisation of referenda,</li>
          <li>organization of demonstrations, boycotts and collective legal actions,</li>
          <li>formation of national and international organizations,</li>
          <li>any kind of project with a commonly defined goal (e.g. the formation of civil movements,
          a day nursery in the neighborhood or a European day of bicycling).</li>

        text_middle: |
          <p>
          echo's  action area bridges the gap between virtual discussions and real-world actions.
          By linking these actions to existing <strong>legislative instruments</strong>,
          echo turns, for the first time, civil engagement into true <strong>political participation</strong>.
          </p>

        act_more: |
          <p>
          <u>For example:</u> 20 000 Bavarian citizens voted against nuclear power – a number large enough to initiate a
          referendum. In a moment, all voters receive a message encouraging them to organize the referendum.
          Following the link included in the message, the users find themselves in a perfectly equipped
          virtual action space, providing all tools and information to collectively plan and organize the action.
          </p><p>
          In order to facilitate an effective collaboration, echo provides participants of an action with all
          <strong>necessary information</strong> and an <strong>appropriate toolset</strong>. Besides the
          innovative decision making function, this toolset contains by default several communication and
          process tools, calendar, event- and task management, file sharing and a fundraising function.
          Thanks to its <strong>modular design</strong>, the offered set of tools can be extended to
          faciliate different sorts of collaboration with specific needs.
          </p>

      echo_on_waves:
        title: Everywhere
        text: |
          <p>
          In order to overcome the limitations of individual platforms, echo employs a
          <strong>distributed approach</strong> and makes its functionality available
          throughout the whole Internet. Accordingly, relevant discussions and actions
          from echo can be displayed and edited on any web page and blog.
          In this way, echo complements the functionality of other platforms and creates
          <strong>true synergies</strong>, instead of hamstringing competition.
          <br/>
          As a result, echo bundles the forces of all existing civil engagement on the Internet and
          enables, for the first time ever, a <strong>broad wave of change</strong> to emerge in society.
          </p><p>
          For the realization of this goal, Google and its brand new <strong>Wave Federation Protocol</strong>
          comes just at the right time.  This open source technology not only allows real time social
          collaboration, but also provides the basis for a secure exchange of decentrally stored data on
          public, organizational and private servers.
          </p><p>
          On the basis of the innovative concept of echo and the groundbreaking technology of
          Google Wave, <strong>echo on waves</strong> lays out the ground for the joint
          development of one of the most ambitious <strong>open source</strong> projects ever:

          </p><p>
          echo facilitates this process through a deliberative intercultural discourse, where

          <p>
          Through their research work and new findings, experts and scientists provide socio-political decisions
          with a solid fundament. With their professional know-how, they can make significant contributions to the
          quality of discussions and to the development of adequate solution proposals.
          For this reason, they are <strong>vitally important actors</strong> on echo and can benefit
          from its <strong>new opportunities</strong> in several ways:
          <p>

        text_top: |
          <p>
          <strong>Political and economic decision makers</strong> carry the largest social responsibility.
          They must decide what best serves the common good and negotiate feasible solutions
          with all stakeholders. Therefore, their participation in discussions on echo is of
          essential importance. If their efforts are to result in sustainable improvements,
          they need to <strong>win broad support from civil society</strong> for their proposals.
          Thus, a comprehensible presentation of their goals and a deep understanding of
          the citizen´s needs are basic prerequisits for their success.
          echo offers <strong>unique opportunities</strong> to politicians and other representatives
          to significantly increase the effectivity of their work:

          <li>Effective and transparent decision making between different administrative levels (municipal ↔ state ↔ EU)</li>

        adv3: Convincing address to voters
        adv3_details: |
          <li>Reaching millions of politically mature citizens directly</li>
          <li>Easily comprehensible presentation of own proposals and arguments</li>
          <li>Clear comparison of different manifestos and own vs. alternative positions on specific topics</li>

        text_top: |
          <p>
          Non-governmental and governmental organizations (NGOs, citizens´ initiatives, political parties,
          trade unions, cities and municipalities) are already in the focus of society and politics and
          are therefore <strong>indispensable actors</strong> on echo. They are opinion leaders, they plan
          actions and campaigns and seek to mobilize a broad range of supporters for them.
          echo provides organisations with <strong>unique opportunities</strong> helping them to
          successfully accomplish their goals:
          </p>

        adv1: Optimized internal collaboration
        adv1_details: |
          <li>Joint elaboration of ideas, convincing arguments and proposals with their own experts and supporters</li>

        adv2: Increased political influence
        adv2_details: |
          <li>Visible participation in public discussions</li>
          <li>Influence on the public opinion and socio-political decisions</li>

        adv3: Mobilization of supporters
        adv3_details: |
          <li>Reaching millions of engaged citizens easily</li>
          <li>Comprehensible presentation of own views and arguments</li>
          <li>Viral spreading of own campaigns and actions</li>

        adv4: Rising financial support

          A little <strong>“h”</strong> can make a huge difference!
          </p><p>
          Accordingly, “echonomy” stands symbolically for an <strong>eco-social democratic economy</strong>
          committed to basic ethical values in our globalized world:
          </p>

        list:
          <li><strong>Sustainability</strong> instead of unconditional growth (eco)</li>
          <li><strong>Dignity and cooperation</strong> instead of "resource" utilization and greed (social)</li>
          <li><strong>Active participation</strong> instead of passive dependence (democratic)</li>

        text_bottom: |
          <p>
          echo´s corporate philosophy reflects these values in several ways and aims to be a
          model for a new kind of corporate culture. Its innovative solutions also seek to
          foster socially and ecologically sustainable business management and a
          <strong>democratization of existing corporate and economic structures</strong>.

          Finance your actions without financial effort!
          </p><p>
          echo combines a <strong><span title="{{tooltip_nonprofit}}" class="ttLink">non-profit</span></strong>
          philosophy with <strong>powerful business models</strong>. "Powerful“ does not merely mean
          working cost-neutral.
          It also means helping people and organizations to provide their actions with the necessary funds.
          For this puropse, echo offers you various <span title="{{tooltip_costneutral}}" class="ttLink">cost-neutral</span>
          ways to collect money on your personal virtual account.
          All funds collected in these ways can then be donated to actions and projects of organisations, interest
          groups and individuals according to your preferences.<br/>
          In this way, your virtual engagement can influence our real world in a positive way.
          </p><p>
          By providing people with <strong>more self-determination</strong> and enabling them to
          <strong>achieve visible changes</strong> in their everyday life, echo helps people to
          free themselves from their sense of powerlessness and restore their <strong>faith in democracy</strong>.
          </p>

        tooltip_nonprofit: |
          echo reserves the right to initially cover its expenses from a part of its revenues.
          However, it is important to note, that all fundraising provisions will be reduced to zero,
          as soon as other business models targeted at commercial users of echo have been
          launched and can fully cover its operating costs. Thereby, echo’s entire finances will, of course,
          remain completely transparent.

        tooltip_costneutral: |
          Donation costs money? Not necessarily! Through echo, you can e.g. go to several online shops and
          have up to 20% of the price you paid for your favourite product transferred onto your virtual
          echo account. In addition, discreet notifications of thematically relevant products and services
          in discussions and actions on echo will help you make strategic and responsible buying decisions.

      foundation:

          <p>
          Besides facilitating direct donations in a cost-neutral manner, echo employs several business models
          to generate <strong>considerable earnings</strong> through its commercial users. All surpluses
          will be transferred completely to the <strong>Echonomy Foundation</strong>, providing total
          transparency of echo’s finances. This foundation will be established for the exclusive purpose of
          supporting innovative projects according to <strong>democratic decisions</strong> of the users of echo.
          </p><p>
          By offering people an easy and cost-neutral way of <strong>financing large joint projects</strong>,
          their virtual engagement can lead to <strong>sustainable changes</strong> in our world.

          <p>
          echo is designed to be a <strong>self-organizing system</strong>. Its innovative decision making
          method is perfectly apt for decisions concerning its own rules and functions.  In this way all
          users can participate increasingly in the evolution of echo, resulting in a <strong>stable
          self-administration</strong> at the end of this process.
          </p><p>
          As echo is an instrument of democratic decision making, maintaining
          <strong>political and financial independence</strong> is of vital importance.
          In order to ensure such independence in the long term, echo will gradually be
          <span title="{{tooltip}}" class="ttLink">passed into the hands</span> of all its users
          at any given time.
          </p><p>
          In this way, echo becomes the quasi <strong>property of humanity</strong>:
          They decide what on echo happens. They define how echo works. They are echo!
          </p>

        tooltip: |
          Besides a reliable and proven self-administration, this act of handing over will depend on
          certain criteria related to a geographically and demographically balanced participation
          of the world´s population. Details will be elaborated on at a later stage in an
          open and transparent process.

        p.s.: echo is much more than a Web 3.0 project with technical innovations.
        Our team is working at many different fronts parallelly - all of which are necessary to
        achieve echo's far reaching socio-political goals. Until closing the first seed-financing round of echo,
        our resources remain very limited. This results in a noticeable slower pace of development,
        than you can surely count on afterwards.
        In order to take off soon and get echo and many other innovative projects financed more easily,
        we are just about to kick-off 'echonomy JAM' - a joint initiative with partners from economy and politics.
        With echonomy JAM, we bring together social entrepreneurs with capital providers from both public and private
        sector and establish a unique marketplace to foster the transition to an eco-socially sustainable,
        democratic economy.
        Please visit www.echonomyJAM.org for more information and an invitation to our Kick-off Event on 27.11.2009.
