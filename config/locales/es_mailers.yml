          Dear {{name}},

          Your improvement proposal

          "*{{ip_title}}*"

          won the most votes. Therefore, you now have the opportunity to incorporate it into the proposal "{{p_title}}".

          *You have {{hours}} hours* to do so. Afterwards you might lose the opportunity to incorporate your idea to the proposal at all - this will depend on the current support of other improvement proposals compared to yours.

          To edit the proposal and *incorporate your idea now*, please follow the link and click the button with the yellow-green arrow in the middle:

          {{p_link}}

          Please be fair and add only the ideas you really proposed in your improvement proposal. The change history is already saved and will be visualized later. :-)

          Many thanks for your contribution - Have fun! ;-)

          Best regards,

          Your echo team

          Dear supporters of the improvement proposal

          "*{{ip_title}}*",

          The author of the improvement proposal did not incorporate it to the proposal "{{p_title}}". As supporters of the idea, you now all have the opportunity to do so *for the next {{hours}} hours*.

          To edit the proposal and *incorporate the idea*, please follow the link and click the button with the yellow-green arrow in the middle:

          {{p_link}}

          The first of you starting to edit the proposal will have the exclusive right to do so - but only for the next 60 minutes!

          Please be fair and add only the ideas that are really proposed in the improvement proposal. The change history is already saved and will be visualized later. :-)

          Many thanks for your contribution - Have fun! ;-)

          Unfortunately, the time for you to incorporate your improvement proposal

          "*{{ip_title}}*"

          into the proposal "{{p_title}}" has expired.

          In case your improvement proposal will be selected for the second time, all supporters of your winner idea will also get the opportunity to incorporate it into the proposal.

          *Looking forward to your further contributions*. :-)
