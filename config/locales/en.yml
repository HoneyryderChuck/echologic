        echologic is a network of free minds and organizations united to realize echo, the global agora!
        echo is an Internet project of a special kind. Our goal is to establish a new kind of participatory
        democracy on the very local, as well as on the regional and global level.
        Accordingly, echo means the end of powerlessness and the beginning of self-determination!

          Dear {{name}},

          A very warm welcome to the echologic community.
          We are happy seeing you join us on our common journey towards a new era of global participatory democracy.

          At echologic, we will introduce more and more functionality enabling you to follow
          and increasingly participate in the evolution of echo.

          We wish you an inspiring and enriching time thoughout our challenging journey and also to
          have much pleasure and fun with the echologic community.

          With the best wishes,

          Your echo team

          p.s.: echo is much more than a Web 3.0 project with technical innovations.
          Our team is working at many different fronts parallelly - all of which are necessary to
          achieve echo's far reaching socio-political goals. Until successful financing of the project,
          our resources remain very limited, resulting in a noticeable slower pace of development,
          than you can count on afterwards.
          In order to take off soon and get echo and many other innovative projects financed more easily,
          we are just about to kick-off 'echonomy JAM' - a joint initiative with partners from economy and politics.
          With echonomy JAM, we bring together social entrepreneurs with investors from both public and private
          sector and establish a unique marketplace to foster the transition to an eco-socially sustainable,
          democratic economy.
          Please visit www.echonomyJAM.org for more information and an invitation to our Kick-off Event on 27.11.2009.
