        echologic is a network of free minds and organizations united to realize echo, the global agora!
        echo is an Internet project of a special kind. Our goal is to establish a new kind of participatory
        democracy on the very local, as well as on the regional and global level.
        Accordingly, echo means the end of powerlessness and the beginning of self-determination!
