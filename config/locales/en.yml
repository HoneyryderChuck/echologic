        title: Why do we need echo?
        
        text:
          The world is changing. Today humanity is facing some serious environmental, economic and humanitarian challenges never seen before. However, satisfactory solutions are not in sight. The lack of transparency in political decision making provokes a growing sense of <b>powerlessnes</b> and <b>political resignation</b> in the population and weakens people's faith in democracy. Calls for <b>transparency</b> and <b>participation</b> are getting louder.<br/>
          New ways have to be found, empowering people to develop adequate solutions to effectively tackle our <span href="#" title="{{tooltip}}" class="ttLink">“glocal” challenges</span>.
          
        tooltip:
          Our ecological, economical and humanitarian challenges at local and global level are tightly related to each other. Instead of trying to tackle them independently, these problems can only be analyzed and solved as a whole with regard to their complex interrelations.
          
      what:
        title: What is echo?
       
        text: |
          echo is the instrument for a new kind of <b>participatory democracy</b> facing these challenges. Unlike <span href="#" title="{{tooltip1}}" class="ttLink">usual Web 2.0 applications</span>, echo provides a clearly structured <span href="#" title="{{tooltip2}}" class="ttLink">opinion base</span> and allows for a solution-oriented social collaboration. It unites technical innovation and human scientific knowledge into a unique concept. This helps people to better understand backgrounds and interrelations of topics, jointly make sound decisions and turn them into reality.<br/>
          Accordingly, echo comes with three main functional areas: <b>Discuss – Connect – Act</b>!</p>
          <p>Through the combination of these three functional areas, echo establishes a unique virtual space for a fully <b>democratic collaboration</b> able to lead to <b>visible results in everyday life</b> of the people with minimal effort.<br/>
          Additionally, by spreading its functionality beyond the limits of individual websites, echo finally lets all forces be bundled for a sustainable change throughout the whole Internet.


        tooltip1: |
          Forums allow for an open discussion but do not provide any structured, measurable results. Group blogs cannot be written by hundreds and thousands of participants. Wikipedia can only maintain its quality through giving the control over the content into the hands of a few administrators – which is completely undemocratic.
          
        tooltip2: |
          In analogy to Wikipedia, providing the biggest open accessible knowledge base with a focus on objective facts, echo aims to provide the world's most comprehensive opinion base focusing on subjective opinions and also to facilitate a constructive discussion on them.

    echo_discuss:
      title: Discuss
      
      text: |
        Get a detailed overview of the current public opinion! Engage in discussions! Convince others of your position!</p>
        <p>The discussion area of echo lets for the first time <b>collective intelligence</b> emerge in a democratic public discourse even with a nearly unlimited number of participants.<br/>
        In order to achieve this, the <b>novel discussion method</b> of echo unites some essential innovations:

        
      clarity: <b>Clearness</b>
      clarity_more: 
        Through only one search entry and a few clicks, echo´s multilingual search mechanism provides you with a clear overview of the most supported positions concerning a specific topic of interest.
      
      transparency: <b>Transparency</b>
      transparency_more:
        On echo, all positions as well as their supporting arguments are permanently presented in contrast to the most relevant alternative ones. This helps people to easily develop a differentiated view and thus to counteract polemic and populism.
        
      detailed_positions: <b>Detailed opinion base</b>
      detailed_positions_more: |
        On echo, all positions as well as their arguments can be supported by the users. This allows you to easily comprehend the exact support of such alternative positions by different groups of the society at any time.<br/><br/>

        <i>For example: How many people in the world are for and against nuclear power? What do the Europeans think? What do physicists say and what about affected people living near Chernobyl or a nuclear waste repository? And finally, what is the position of a certain organisation?</i>

      democratic: <b>Democratic opinion formation</b>
      democratic_more: |
        On echo, all positions represent sound statements elaborated by the users in a <span href="#" title="{{tooltip}}" class="ttLink">fully democractic process</span>. Thus, all people can contribute to the dynamic evolution of such statements with equal chance and a minimal effort.

      democratic_tooltip:
        The collective development of such statements on echo does (in the normal case) not depend on moderators or any users with privileged roles. This ensures all participants to have equal voice in the whole discussion process of echo.
        
      glocal_view: <b>Glocal Overview</b>
      glocal_view_more: |
        echo helps people to easily comprehend thematic interrelations between local, regional and global topics.<br/><br/>

        <i>For example: Prices at the supermarket in the neighbourhood => factory farming in the EU => deforestation for soy-plantation => world climate change.</i><br/><br/>

        This “glocal” overview enables users to see local issues in their global context and to understand global problems as a result of local circumstances. People, who visit echo because of a very local topic of personal interest (prices in the supermarket), get quickly confronted with its global implications (world climate).
    
    echo_connect:
      title: Connect
      
      text_top: |
        Find the right allies to achive your goals!</p>
        
        <p>In contrast to current social networks, echo offers a highly specific search mechanism to easily <b>find allies with different competences</b> relevant to a certain topic. Accordingly, echo sorts all found users into different groups mirroring the most important segments of society. These are:
   
      list: &competences |
        <li>Citizens and affected people (with competence of need)</li>
        <li>Experts and scientists (with professional competence)</li>
        <li>Representatives and politicians (with decision making competence)</li>
        <li>Non-governmental and governmental organizations (with mobilizing potential)</li>
        
      text_bottom: |
        echo actively motivates dialogue and collaboration between these groups. By incorporating the needs und competences of these segments of society, echo enables people to jointly identify issues of common interest and develop <b>the best possible solutions</b> for them.

        
    echo_act:
      title: Act
      
      text_top: |
        Become active! Reach your goals successfully!</p>
        
        <p>To <b>achieve noticeable results in everyday life</b> of the people, echo motivates all participants of a discussion to create appropriate actions to turn their proposals into reality. By bundling all local, regional and global actions supporting a common goal, echo creates new synergies and boosts the influence potential of <b>civil engagment</b>. The range of supported actions on echo covers:
        
      possible_actions: |
        <li>digitally signed e-petitions,</li>
        <li>organisation of referenda,</li>
        <li>organization of demonstrations, boycotts and class-action lawsuits,</li>
        <li>foundation of national and international organizations,</li>
        <li>any kind of project with a commonly defined goal (e.g. the formation of civil movements, a day nursery in the neighborhood or a European day of bicycling).</li>

      text_middle: |
        echo's  action area bridges the gap between virtual discussions and real-world actions. By linking these actions to existing <b>legislative instruments</b>, echo turns, for the first time, civil engagement into true <b>political participation</b>.
        
      example: |
        For example: 20 000 Bavarian citizens voted against nuclear power – many enough to initiate a referendum. In a moment, all voters receive a message encouraging them to organize the referendum. Following the link included in the message, the users find themselves in a perfectly equipped virtual action space, providing all tools and information to collectively plan and organize the action.
        
      act_more: |
        In order to facilitate an effective collaboration, echo provides participants of an action with all necessary information and an appropriate toolset. Besides the innovative decision making function, this toolset contains by default several communication and process tools, calendar, event- and task management, file sharing and a fundraising function. Thanks to its modular design, the offered set of tools can be extended to faciliate collaboration able to fulfill specific needs. 

    echo_echo_on_waves:
      title: Everywhere
      text: |
        In order to overcome the limitations of individual platforms, echo employs a <b>distributed approach</b> and makes its functionality available throughout the whole Internet. Accordingly, relevant discussions and actions from echo can be displayed and edited on any web page and blog. In this way, echo complements the functionality of other platforms and aims to create <b>true synergies</b>, instead of debilitating competition.</p>
        
        <p>As a result, echo bundles the forces of all existing civil engagement on the Internet and lets, for the first time ever, a broad <b>wave of change</b> emerge in the society.</p>

        <p>For the realization of this goal, Google and its brand new <b>Wave Federation Protocol</b> comes just at the right time. This open source technology allows not only for real time social collaboration. It also provides the basis for a safe exchange of decentrally stored data on public, organizational and private servers.</p>

        <p>On the basis of the innovative concept of echo and the groundbreaking technology of Google Wave, <b>echo on waves</b> lays out the ground for the joint development of one of the most ambitious <b>open source</b> projects ever:</p>

        <p>The creation of a <b>global agora</b>!

        “echocracy” stands for the new form of <b>participatory democracy</b> of echo. It empowers you and people from all over the world to jointly discuss issues of common interest and develop the best possible solutions for them.</p>
        <p>echo facilitates this by a deliberative intercultural discours, where competences from the most important segments of society are all incorporated into a collective <b>decision making</b> process. These segments of society are:

        
      list: *competences
      
      text_bottom:
        On echo, actors of these competence groups (with resprect to a certain topic) can engage into an <b>equal dialogue</b>. This ensures not only <b>total transparency</b> throughout the whole decision making process. It also enables echo to offer all its actors whole new means of contribution to the joint shaping our world.</p>
        
        <p>On echo, the global agora, all participants are equal, <b>free world citizens</b>!

        Political decisions can be characterized by three different social dimensions:

        <ol>
          <li>They are based on a commonly recognized knowledge (common sense)</li>
          <li>They are elaborated by decision makers.</li>
          <li>They are legitimized by citizens democratically electing the decision makers.</li>
        </ol>
        
        Sadly, these three dimensions tend to be separated in time and space. Thus, decision makers deliberate with experts and scientists, but not with their citizens. Citizens, on the other hand, do not fully understand the background of political decisions and legitimize them only in advance by periodical elections – not by their vote in actual decision making processes. This lack of transparency results in a growing political resignation and a declining turnout of voters.

    echocracy_citizens:
      title: Citizens
      
      text_top: |
        A vivid participation in decision making and civil engagement in all different countries is the main objective of echo. Engaged citizens, already actively campaigning for a peaceful, equitable and sustainable future, are therefore the most important actors of echo and can especially benefit from its new opportunities:

      
      list: |-
        <li><b>Informative overview</b> of the current public opinion of different social groups and regions</li>

        Due to their professional know-how, experts and scientists can significantly contribute to the quality of discussions and the development of adequate solution proposals. For this reason, they are vitally important actors of echo and can benefit from its new opportunities in several ways:
        
      adv1: '<b>Improved scientific discourse</b>'
      adv1_details: |
        <li>Transparent debates with clearly differentiated positions of different scientific disciplines</li>

      title: Decision Makers
      text_top: |
        Political and economic decision makers carry the largest social responsibility. They must decide, what common good is best served by and negotiate feasible solutions with all stakeholders. Therefore, their participation in discussions on echo is of essential importance. To let their effort result in sustainable improvements, they need to win a broad support of citizens for their proposals. Thus, a transparent presentation of their goals  and a deep understanding of the citizen´s needs are basic prerequisits for their success. echo offers unique opportunities to politicians and other representatives to significantly lighten their work:
        
      adv1: '<b>Detailed opinion base</b>'
      adv1_details: |
        <li>Clear overview of the main needs and opinions of their voters</li>

        Non-governmental and governmental organizations (NGOs, citizens´ initiatives, political parties, trade unions, cities and municipalities) are already in the focus of societal and political life and are therefore indispensable actors of echo. They are opinion leaders, they plan actions and campaigns and seek to mobilize a broad range of supporters for them. echo provides organisations with unique opportunities helping them to successfully accomplish their goals:
        
      adv1: '<b>Optimized internal collaboration</b>'

      subtitle: The Values
      
      text_top: |
        A little “h” can make a huge difference!</p>
        <p>Accordingly, “echonomy” stands symbolically for an eco-social democratic economy committed to basic ethical values:

      list:
        <li><b>Sustainability</b> instead of unconditional growth (eco)</li>
        <li><b>Dignity</b> instead of exploitation (social)</li>
        <li><b>Participation</b> instead of dependance (democratic)</li>

      text_bottom: |
        echo´s corporate philosophy reflects these values in several ways and aims to be a model for a new kind of corporate culture. Its innovative solutions also seek to foster socially and ecologically sustainable business management and a further democratization of existing corporate and economic structures.

        Finance your actions <b>without</b> financial effort!

        echo combines a <span href="#" title="{{tooltip_nonprofit}}" class="ttLink">non-profit</span> philosophy with <b>powerful business models</b>. "Powerful“ does not merely mean working <span href="#" title="{{tooltip_costneutral}}" class="ttLink">cost neutral</span>. It also means helping people and organizations to provide their actions with the necessary funds. For this puropse, echo offers you various cost-neutral ways to collect money on your personal virtual account. All funds collected this way can then be donated to actions and projects of yours or those of other actors according to your liking!<br/>
        In this way, your virtual engagement can influence our real world in a positive way.</p>

        <p>By providing people with <b>more self-determination</b> and enabling them to <b>achieve visible changes</b> in their everyday life, echo helps people to free themselves from their sense of powerlessness and restore their <b>faith in democracy</b>.

      tooltip_nonprofit: |
        echo preserves the right to initially cover its expenses by a part of its fundraising revenues. However, all fundraising provisions will be reduced to zero, as soon as other business models targeted on commercial users of echo are launched to fully cover its cost of operation. Thereby, all financials of echo will of course be kept completely transparent.

      tooltip_costneutral:
        Donation costs money? Not necessarily! Through echo, you can e.g. go to several online-shops and up to 20% of the price you payed for your favourite product transferred onto your virtual echo account. In addition, discreet notifications of thematically relevant products and services in discussions and actions on echo will help you meet strategic and responsible buying decisions.
      
    echonomy_foundation:

      text: |
        Besides facilitating direct donations in a cost-neutral manner, echo employs several business models to generate <b>considerable earnings</b> through its commercial users. Thereby, all surplus will be completely transferred to the <b>Echonomy Foundation</b> providing total transparency on the financials of echo.
        This foundation will be formed with the exclusive purpose to support innovative projects according to democratic decisions of the users of echo.</p>

        <p>By offering people an easy and cost-neutral way for <b>financing large joint projects</b>, their virtual engagement can lead to sustainable long term changes in our world.

      text: |
        echo is designed to be a <b>self-organizing system</b>. Its innovative decision making method is perfectly apt for decisions concerning its own rules and functions. In this way, all users can participate in the evolution of echo with a gradually growing weight, resulting in a stable self-administration at the end of this process.
        Being an instrument of democratic decision making, maintaining <b>political and financial independence</b> is of vital importance for echo. In order to ensure this in the long term, echo will gradually be <span title="{{tooltip}}" class="ttLink">passed into the hands</span> of all its users at any one time.</p>
        
        <p>In this way, echo becomes the quasi <b>property of humanity</b>: They decide what on echo happens. They define how echo works. They are echo!


      tooltip: |
        Besides a reliable and proven self-administration, this act of handing over will depend on certain criteria related to a geographically and demographically balanced participation of the world´s population. Details concerning this issue will later be elaborated in an open and transparent process.
