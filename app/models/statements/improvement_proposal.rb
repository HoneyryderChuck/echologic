# Specification of an ImprovementProposal

# * ImprovementProposals do mostly refer to the actual document / text of a proposal. They do no represent a different standpoint, but more a different approach to formulate one. 
# * currently an Improvementproposal does always refer to a proposal, and does not expect further children
